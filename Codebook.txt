Codebook for Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project:

The following text files are used in this project:

Descriptive files:
  - activity_labels.txt  --> dataset activity_labels
    file containing the description for the 6 activities measured
  - features.txt         --> dataset features     
    file containing the description of the 561 values measured for each activity

test dataset:
  - subject_test.txt     --> dataset subject_test
    file containing the subject id for each measurement in X_test.txt
  - X_test.txt           --> dataset X_test  
    file containing 561 measurements per line
  - y_test.txt           --> dataset y_test
    file containing the activity for each measurement in X_test.txt
Training dataset
  - subject_train.txt    --> dataset subject_train
    file containing the subject id for each measurement in X_train.txt
  - X_train.txt          --> dataset X_train
    file containing 561 measurements per line
  - y_train.txt          --> dataset y_train
    file containing the activity for each measurement in X_train.txt
  
The total & tidy dataset of all combined is stored in dataframe X:
- X = X_test added to X_train using rbind
- subject = subject_test added to subject_train using rbind
- y = y_test added to y_train by using rbind
- replacing the non-descriptive column names V... by taking the descriptive name from
  dataframe activity_labels
- Removing columns from dataframe X not containing a mean or std measurement by 
  subsetting on column names that contain either "mean()" or "std()" using grep.
  From the original 561 measurement variables 66 remain
- adding the column Subject to X from dataframe subject using cbind as first column
- adding the column Activity to X from dataframe y using cbind as second column

The tidy dataframe Xmeans contains the average (mean) of each of the 66 measurement 
variables per subject and activity
This is constructed by melting the measurements from Xvper subject/activity combination
and then casting back to a dataframe calculating the mean of each variable.

Finally a text file Xmeans.txt is created in the main directory from dataframe Xmeans.
